# Savings_Planner_Tool
An informational tool to plan your savings and investments in a realistic way.

#### Why this app?

New investors face a difficult task in comprehending the number of investment opportunities available to them in the ever-changing world of financial markets. The lack of a reliable tool for projecting interest earnings over a spectrum of low- to high-risk products exacerbates the problem, resulting in inefficient investment strategies and missed opportunities.
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive predictive platform capable of calculating interest earnings across a wide range of financial instruments, from low-risk to high-risk alternatives.

#### What does this app do?

- It calculates the minimum amount of money you will have to contribute to your portfolio each year in order to be able to reach your saving goal.
- It takes into account five forms of investment: 
    - Traditional bank accounts
    - Government bills
    - S&P 500 stocks
    - Real estate
    - Bitcoin
- It quantifies the risk involved with an investment from _very low_ risk (government bills for examples) to _very high_ risk (common stocks for example).
- It allows the user to personalize the portfolio in terms of risks or in terms of allocation and rates of return.
- It takes into account the country (here Canada only) in which the user wants to invest.

#### Future scope

- To deploy the app on a web hosting platform like Heroku.
- To add more financial products.
